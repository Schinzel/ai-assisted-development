# AI-Assisted Development

A practical guide for implementing AI-assisted development workflows in software teams. 

It is the type of development where the developer goes through all code generated by the AI and commonly requests or does changes.

This repository contains resources, templates, and examples to help teams effectively integrate AI assistants and agents into their software development workflows. 
It provides structured guidance for leveraging AIs to enhance productivity while maintaining code quality and consistency.

Here is a real life example of this standard in practice:
